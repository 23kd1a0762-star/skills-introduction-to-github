## Welcome to GitHub! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is your starting point for learning GitHub. Whether you're new to version control or just getting started with Git and GitHub, this guide will help you understand the basics.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

## Getting Started with GitHub

### Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository. It allows you to work on different versions of your project at once.
- **Commit**: A saved change to your repository. Each commit has a unique ID and includes a message describing what changed.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A way to propose changes to a repository. Others can review your changes before they're merged.
- **Fork**: A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account.
- **Clone**: A local copy of a repository that lives on your computer.

### Essential Git Commands

Here are some basic Git commands you'll use frequently:

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Check the status of your files
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add <filename>
git add .  # Add all changes

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin <branch-name>

# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin <branch-name>

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

# Switch between branches
git checkout <branch-name>

# View commit history
git log
```

## Your First GitHub Workflow

1. **Create a repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone** it to your local machine
3. **Create a branch** for your changes
4. **Make changes** to files
5. **Commit** your changes with a descriptive message
6. **Push** your branch to GitHub
7. **Open a pull request** to propose your changes
8. **Merge** your pull request after review
